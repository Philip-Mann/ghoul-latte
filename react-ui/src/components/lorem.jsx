                Sit and stare throwup on your pillow,
                or chew on cable. Bathe private parts 
                with tongue then lick owner's face why 
                must they do that walk on keyboard plop 
                down in the middle where everybody walks 
                ask to go outside and ask to come inside 
                and ask to go outside and ask to come inside, 
                get suspicious of own shadow then go play with
                toilette paper. Immediately regret falling into 
                bathtub claws in the eye of the beholder poop on 
                floor and watch human clean up. Experiences short
                bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo leave
                hair everywhere sleep good morning sunshine so 
                climb leg, yet open the door, let me out, let me 
                out, let me-out, let me-aow, let meaow, meaow!
                or thinking longingly about tuna brine. Kitty
